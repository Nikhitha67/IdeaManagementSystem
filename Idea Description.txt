The Idea Management Portal is a user-friendly online platform designed specifically for
students at MITE. It serves as a creative space where students from any year or department can
submit their innovative ideas. This portal helps students develop critical thinking skills, take
initiative, and start new projects. Since itâ€™s separate from the main institute website, it is easier
for students to navigate and use it regularly. The platform also supports innovation by hosting
various challenges and competitions, encouraging students to constantly push their creative
boundaries. Additionally, by submitting their ideas, students can get valuable feedback from
faculty members who guide them in their ideas and turning those ideas into practical projects.
This promotes a collaborative environment, ultimately benefiting both students and the
institution. Furthermore, this portal aims to foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship at
MITE. It provides students with a platform to not only share their ideas but also to learn the
process of developing them into real-world applications. The Idea Management Portal is a
system for bringing new, innovative solutions that can contribute to the growth of MITE as a
hub of creativity.
